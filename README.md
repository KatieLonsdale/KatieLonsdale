<p> Passionate about building efficient, scalable, and user-focused solutions. Over 2 years experience building software integrations and APIs. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges with code quality and long-term solutions in mind.

I embrace AI tools and enhancements as game changers for software developers. We are in an exciting time for technology and I am excited to continue using new technologies to be the best developer I can be.

In my free time, I enjoy running, games (board and video), and working on side projects</p>
